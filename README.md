## Lessons Learned

This is my first project at university in Computer Science major. During the time, I have learned how
to write algorithms to add, multiply and divide large integers given as strings; allocate computer memory wisely; design a program logic and 
apply multiple languages to accomplish the final goal. As a result, I have widened my knowledge of the this field.
